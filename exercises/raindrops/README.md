# Raindrops

Your task is to convert a number into a string that contains raindrop sounds corresponding to certain potential factors. A factor is a number that evenly divides into another number, leaving no remainder. The simplest way to test if a one number is a factor of another is to use the [modulo operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation).

The rules of `raindrops` are that if a given number:

- has 3 as a factor, add 'Pling' to the result.
- has 5 as a factor, add 'Plang' to the result.
- has 7 as a factor, add 'Plong' to the result.
- _does not_ have any of 3, 5, or 7 as a factor, the result should be the digits of the number.

## Examples

- 28 has 7 as a factor, but not 3 or 5, so the result would be "Plong".
- 30 has both 3 and 5 as factors, but not 7, so the result would be "PlingPlang".
- 34 is not factored by 3, 5, or 7, so the result would be "34".


## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
