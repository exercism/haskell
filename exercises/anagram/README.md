# Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given `"listen"` and a list of candidates like `"enlists" "google"
"inlets" "banana"` the program should return a list containing
`"inlets"`.

## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to implement the function `anagramsFor`,
that takes a *word* and a group of *words*, returning the ones that are
anagrams of the given *word*.

If it is your first time solving this exercise, it is recommended that you
stick to the provided signature:

```haskell
anagramsFor :: String -> [String] -> [String]
```

Later, it may be a good idea to revisit this problem and play with other data
types and libraries:

- `Text`, from package *text*.
- `Sequence` and `Set`, from package *containers*.
- `MultiSet`, from package *multiset*

The test suite was intentionally designed to accept almost any type signature
that makes sense, so you are encouraged to find the one you think is the best.



## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
