# Lens Person

Use lenses to update nested records (specific to languages with immutable data).

Updating fields of nested records is kind of annoying in Haskell. One solution
is to use [lenses](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lens).  Implement several record
accessing functions using lenses, you may use any library you want. The test
suite also allows you to avoid lenses altogether so you can experiment with
different approaches.


## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests

The [exercism/haskell](https://github.com/exercism/haskell) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Haskell exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!

## Submitting Incomplete Solutions
It's possible to submit an incomplete solution so you can see how others have completed the exercise.
