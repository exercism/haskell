## Hints

Haskell has support for many types of arrays. This exercise uses immutable,
boxed, non-strict arrays from `Data.Array`. You can read more about the use of
these arrays on:

- [A Gentle Introduction to Haskell: Arrays][1]
- The documentation for [`Data.Array`][2]

As an optional extension to this exercise, try and make the `find` function
work for arrays with arbitrary bounds, e.g. arrays for which the first index is
not necessarily 0.
