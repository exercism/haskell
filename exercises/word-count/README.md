# Word Count

Given a phrase, count the occurrences of each _word_ in that phrase.

For the purposes of this exercise you can expect that a _word_ will always be one of:

1. A _number_ composed of one or more ASCII digits (ie "0" or "1234") OR
2. A _simple word_ composed of one or more ASCII letters (ie "a" or "they") OR
3. A _contraction_ of two _simple words_ joined by a single apostrophe (ie "it's" or "they're")

When counting words you can assume the following rules:

1. The count is _case insensitive_ (ie "You", "you", and "YOU" are 3 uses of the same word)
2. The count is _unordered_; the tests will ignore how words and counts are ordered
3. Other than the apostrophe in a _contraction_ all forms of _punctuation_ are ignored
4. The words can be separated by _any_ form of whitespace (ie "\t", "\n", " ")

For example, for the phrase `"That's the password: 'PASSWORD 123'!", cried the Special Agent.\nSo I fled.` the count would be:

```text
that's: 1
the: 2
password: 2
123: 1
cried: 1
special: 1
agent: 1
so: 1
i: 1
fled: 1
```

## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to implement the function `wordCount`,
that takes a *text* and returns how many times each *word* appears.

If it is your first time solving this exercise, it is recommended that you
stick to the provided signature:

```haskell
wordCount :: String -> [(String, Int)]
```

Later, it may be a good idea to revisit this problem and play with other data
types and libraries:

- `Text`, from package *text*.
- `Map`, from package *containers*.
- `MultiSet`, from package *multiset*

The test suite was intentionally designed to accept almost any type signature
that makes sense, so you are encouraged to find the one you think is the best.



## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```

This is a classic toy problem, but we were reminded of it by seeing it in the Go Tour.
