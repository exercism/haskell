## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `ForthState`
and implement the following functions:

- `emptyState` returns an empty `ForthState`.
- `evalText` evaluates an input Text, returning the new state.
- `toList` returns the current stack as a list, with the element on top
of the stack being the rightmost (last) element.

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
