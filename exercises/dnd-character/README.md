# D&D Character

For a game of [Dungeons & Dragons][DND], each player starts by generating a
character they can play with. This character has, among other things, six
abilities; strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom and
charisma. These six abilities have scores that are determined randomly. You
do this by rolling four 6-sided dice and record the sum of the largest three
dice. You do this six times, once for each ability.

Your character's initial hitpoints are 10 + your character's constitution
modifier. You find your character's constitution modifier by subtracting 10
from your character's constitution, divide by 2 and round down.

Write a random character generator that follows the rules above.

For example, the six throws of four dice may look like:

* 5, 3, 1, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 5 + 3 + 6 = 14, which you assign to strength.
* 3, 2, 5, 3: You discard the 2 and sum 3 + 5 + 3 = 11, which you assign to dexterity.
* 1, 1, 1, 1: You discard the 1 and sum 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which you assign to constitution.
* 2, 1, 6, 6: You discard the 1 and sum 2 + 6 + 6 = 14, which you assign to intelligence.
* 3, 5, 3, 4: You discard the 3 and sum 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, which you assign to wisdom.
* 6, 6, 6, 6: You discard the 6 and sum 6 + 6 + 6 = 18, which you assign to charisma.

Because constitution is 3, the constitution modifier is -4 and the hitpoints are 6.

## Notes

Most programming languages feature (pseudo-)random generators, but few
programming languages are designed to roll dice. One such language is [Troll].

## Hints

This exercise uses QuickCheck generators. Here are some resources to get started:

- [A QuickCheck Tutorial: Generators](https://www.stackbuilders.com/news/a-quickcheck-tutorial-generators)
- The documentation for [Test.QuickCheck.Gen](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/QuickCheck-2.12.6.1/docs/Test-QuickCheck-Gen.html)



## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
