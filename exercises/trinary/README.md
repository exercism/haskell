# Trinary

Convert a trinary number, represented as a string (e.g. '102012'), to its
decimal equivalent using first principles.

The program should consider strings specifying an invalid trinary as the
value 0.

Trinary numbers contain three symbols: 0, 1, and 2.

The last place in a trinary number is the 1's place. The second to last
is the 3's place, the third to last is the 9's place, etc.

```shell
# "102012"
    1       0       2       0       1       2    # the number
1*3^5 + 0*3^4 + 2*3^3 + 0*3^2 + 1*3^1 + 2*3^0    # the value
  243 +     0 +    54 +     0 +     3 +     2 =  302
```

If your language provides a method in the standard library to perform the
conversion, pretend it doesn't exist and implement it yourself.

## Hints

For the appropriate amount of challenge here, you should only
use functionality present in Prelude. Try not to use Data.List,
Data.Char, Data.Bits, or Numeric.

Try and use seq, $!, or BangPatterns appropriately to ensure
that the solution is efficient.

Handling invalid input is not necessary.

If you've done the Octal exercise, perhaps you should generalize it.



## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
