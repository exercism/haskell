## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `CustomSet`,
with `Eq` and `Show` instances, and implement the following functions:

- `delete`
- `difference`
- `empty`
- `fromList`
- `insert`
- `intersection`
- `isDisjointFrom`
- `isSubsetOf`
- `member`
- `null`
- `size`
- `toList`
- `union`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.

If you're interested in writing an efficient implementation but don't quite
know where to start, the best primer I know of is Chris Okasaki's
"Purely Functional Data Structures", which you can read a version of here:
