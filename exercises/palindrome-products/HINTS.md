## Hints

To solve this exercise you need to implement these two functions:

- `largestPalindrome`
- `smallestPalindrome`

Both functions receive lower and upper factor limits, returning a pair
`(value, [(factor1, factor2)])` containing the palindrome and its possible
pairs of factors.

Your can use the provided signatures if you are unsure about the types, but
don't let them restrict your creativity.

It's ok to return duplicates in the factors list, and the order of the factors
is irrelevant.

You should consider using a slightly different algorithm to find small or
large palindromes.
