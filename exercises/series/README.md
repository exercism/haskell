# Series

Given a string of digits, output all the contiguous substrings of length `n` in
that string in the order that they appear.

For example, the string "49142" has the following 3-digit series:

- "491"
- "914"
- "142"

And the following 4-digit series:

- "4914"
- "9142"

And if you ask for a 6-digit series from a 5-digit string, you deserve
whatever you get.

Note that these series are only required to occupy *adjacent positions*
in the input; the digits need not be *numerically consecutive*.

## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to implement the function `slices`,
that takes a *text* and returns the subsequences of digits with a
specified size:

If it is your first time solving this exercise, it is recommended that you
stick to the provided signature:

```haskell
slices :: Int -> String -> [[Int]]
```

Later, it may be a good idea to revisit this problem and play with other data
types and libraries:

- `ByteString`, from package *bytestring*.
- `Sequence`, from package *containers*.
- `Text`, from package *text*.
- `Vector`, from package *vector*.

The test suite was intentionally designed to accept almost any type signature
that makes sense, so you are encouraged to find the one you think is the best.



## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
