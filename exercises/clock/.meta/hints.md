## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to define the data type `Clock`,
add an `Eq` instance, and implement the functions:

- addDelta
- fromHourMin
- toString

`addDelta` adds a duration, expressed in hours and minutes, to a given time,
represented by an instance of `Clock`.

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
