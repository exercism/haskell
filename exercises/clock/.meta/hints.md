## Hints

It's a 24 hour clock going from "00:00" to "23:59".

To complete this exercise you need to define the data type `Clock`,
add an `Eq` instance, and implement the functions:

- addDelta
- fromHourMin
- toString

`addDelta` adds a duration, expressed in hours and minutes, to a given time,
represented by an instance of `Clock`.

`fromHourMin` takes an hour and minute, and returns an instance of `Clock` with 
those hours and minutes.

`toString` takes an instance of `Clock` and returns a string representation 
of the clock, in 0-padded format like "08:03" or "22:35"

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
