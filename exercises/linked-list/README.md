# Linked List

Implement a doubly linked list.

Like an array, a linked list is a simple linear data structure. Several
common data types can be implemented using linked lists, like queues,
stacks, and associative arrays.

A linked list is a collection of data elements called *nodes*. In a
*singly linked list* each node holds a value and a link to the next node.
In a *doubly linked list* each node also holds a link to the previous
node.

You will write an implementation of a doubly linked list. Implement a
Node to hold a value and pointers to the next and previous nodes. Then
implement a List which holds references to the first and last node and
offers an array-like interface for adding and removing items:

* `push` (*insert value at back*);
* `pop` (*remove value at back*);
* `shift` (*remove value at front*).
* `unshift` (*insert value at front*);

To keep your implementation simple, the tests will not cover error
conditions. Specifically: `pop` or `shift` will never be called on an
empty list.

If you want to know more about linked lists, check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list).

## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Deque`
and implement the following functions:

- `mkDeque`
- `pop`
- `push`
- `unshift`
- `shift`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.



## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
