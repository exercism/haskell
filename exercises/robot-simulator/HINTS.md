## Hints

To complete this exercise, you need to create the data type `Robot`,
and implement the following functions:

- `bearing`
- `coordinates`
- `mkRobot`
- `simulate`
- `turnLeft`
- `turnRight`

You will find a dummy data declaration and type signatures already in place,
but it is up to you to define the functions and create a meaningful data type,
newtype or type synonym.
