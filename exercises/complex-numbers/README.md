# Complex Numbers

A complex number is a number in the form `a + b * i` where `a` and `b` are real and `i` satisfies `i^2 = -1`.

`a` is called the real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`.
The conjugate of the number `a + b * i` is the number `a - b * i`.
The absolute value of a complex number `z = a + b * i` is a real number `|z| = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`. The square of the absolute value `|z|^2` is the result of multiplication of `z` by its complex conjugate.

The sum/difference of two complex numbers involves adding/subtracting their real and imaginary parts separately:
`(a + i * b) + (c + i * d) = (a + c) + (b + d) * i`,
`(a + i * b) - (c + i * d) = (a - c) + (b - d) * i`.

Multiplication result is by definition
`(a + i * b) * (c + i * d) = (a * c - b * d) + (b * c + a * d) * i`.

The reciprocal of a non-zero complex number is
`1 / (a + i * b) = a/(a^2 + b^2) - b/(a^2 + b^2) * i`.

Dividing a complex number `a + i * b` by another `c + i * d` gives:
`(a + i * b) / (c + i * d) = (a * c + b * d)/(c^2 + d^2) + (b * c - a * d)/(c^2 + d^2) * i`.

Exponent of a complex number can be expressed as
`exp(a + i * b) = exp(a) * exp(i * b)`,
and the last term is given by Euler's formula `exp(i * b) = cos(b) + i * sin(b)`.


Implement the following operations:
 - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of two complex numbers,
 - conjugate, absolute value, exponent of a given complex number.


Assume the programming language you are using does not have an implementation of complex numbers.


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
