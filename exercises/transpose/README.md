# Transpose

Given an input text output it transposed.

Roughly explained, the transpose of a matrix:

```text
ABC
DEF
```

is given by:

```text
AD
BE
CF
```

Rows become columns and columns become rows. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transpose>.

If the input has rows of different lengths, this is to be solved as follows:

- Pad to the left with spaces.
- Don't pad to the right.

Therefore, transposing this matrix:

```text
ABC
DE
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
C
```

And transposing:

```text
AB
DEF
```

results in:

```text
AD
BE
 F
```

In general, all characters from the input should also be present in the transposed output.
That means that if a column in the input text contains only spaces on its bottom-most row(s),
the corresponding output row should contain the spaces in its right-most column(s).


## Getting Started

Please refer to the [installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/installation)
and [learning](https://exercism.io/tracks/haskell/learning) help pages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
