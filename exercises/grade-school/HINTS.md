## Hints

To complete this exercise you need to create the data type `School`
and implement the following functions:

- `add`
- `empty`
- `grade`
- `sorted`

You will find a dummy data declaration already in place, but it is up to you to
define the functions and create a meaningful data type, newtype or type
synonym.
