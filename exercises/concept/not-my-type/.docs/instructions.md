# Instructions

In this exercise you are going to show your understanding of types. 

The exercise presents a list of questions, each question consists of an expression identified by the letters a through f, and a list of answers with empty strings (""). Your job is to replace the empty strings with the type of the expression for that letter.

You can use the Glasgow Haskell Compiler's interactive mode (GHCi), if you have GHC installed, by typing `ghci` at the command prompt, but it is not required to complete this exercise.
