# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to import functions from modules.
- Know how to export functions for use by other modules.
- Know how to define type annotations for functions.
- Know how to work with integers and floats.
- Know how to use basic string operations.

## Out of scope

- The Html module, which is required to define a minimal compilable Elm application with a "main", but involves more concepts.

## Concepts

- `basics-2`

## Prequisites

- `basics`

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from an analyzer including the following rules:

- Verify that functions have type annotations.
- Verify that the whitespace adheres to community defaults.
