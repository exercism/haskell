# Hints

## 1. Convert pence to pounds

- Define a function `penceToPounds :: Int -> Float` to take the number of pence, turn it to a float, and devide that by 100 to make it pounds.

## 2. Format the price for display on the website

- Define `poundsToString :: Float -> String` to take the number of pounds (a `Float`)) and return the string "Â£" concatenated to the string representation of the number of pounds.
- You will need to `import ToString`.
