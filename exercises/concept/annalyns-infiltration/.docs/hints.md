# Hints

## General

- There are three boolean operators to work with boolean values: `not`, `&&`, and `||`.
- Multiple operators can be combined in a single expression.

## 1. Check if a fast attack can be made

- The boolean operators can also be applied to boolean parameters.
- Unlike many other languages, boolean negation is _not_ done with the `!` operator.
