# General

Temperature in degrees Celsius is defined as: T(°F) = T(°C) × 1.8 + 32

Temperature in degrees Fahrenheit is defined as: T(°C) = (T(°F) - 32) / 1.8

## Type conversion

Remember the temperature is provided as Integer, but your function will pass it through operations that expect Floats. The function `fromInteger` will come in handy.

### Return Type

Remember you must return a Float representing the temperature, not a string.
