# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know what [pattern matching][pattern-matching] is.
- Know about constant, variable and wildcard patterns.
- Know about guards.
- Know about exhaustiveness checking in pattern matching.

## Out of scope

- Other patterns besides the constant and wildcard patterns.
- Lazy pattern matching.
- `case` statements.

## Concepts

- `pattern-matching`: know what [pattern matching][pattern-matching] is; know about constant, variable and wildcard patterns; know how to use guards; know about exhaustiveness checking in pattern matching.

## Prerequisites

- `basics`: function definitions
- `numbers`: numeric types and operators
