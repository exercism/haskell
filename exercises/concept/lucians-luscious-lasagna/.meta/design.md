# Design

## Learning objectives

- Know how to define a Haskell module / Haskell file.
- Know how to export functions for use by other modules.
- Know how to define a constant.
- Know how to define a function.
- Know how to indent code.
- Know how to use basic math operators on numbers.
- Know how to define single- and multiline comments.

## Out of scope

- The IO module, which is required to define a minimal Haskell application with a "main", but involves more concepts.

## Concepts

- `basics`

## Prequisites

There are no prerequisites.

## Analyzer

This exercise could benefit from an analyser that includes the following rules:

- Verify that the whitespace adheres to community defaults.
- Verify that functions are re-used in other functions.
