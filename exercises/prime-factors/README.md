# Prime Factors

Compute the prime factors of a given natural number.

A prime number is only evenly divisible by itself and 1.

Note that 1 is not a prime number.

## Example

What are the prime factors of 60?

- Our first divisor is 2. 2 goes into 60, leaving 30.
- 2 goes into 30, leaving 15.
  - 2 doesn't go cleanly into 15. So let's move on to our next divisor, 3.
- 3 goes cleanly into 15, leaving 5.
  - 3 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 4.
  - 4 does not go cleanly into 5. The next possible factor is 5.
- 5 does go cleanly into 5.
- We're left only with 1, so now, we're done.

Our successful divisors in that computation represent the list of prime
factors of 60: 2, 2, 3, and 5.

You can check this yourself:

- 2 * 2 * 3 * 5
- = 4 * 15
- = 60
- Success!


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```

## Feedback, Issues, Pull Requests

The [exercism/haskell](https://github.com/exercism/haskell) repository on
GitHub is the home for all of the Haskell exercises.

If you have feedback about an exercise, or want to help implementing a new
one, head over there and create an issue.  We'll do our best to help you!
