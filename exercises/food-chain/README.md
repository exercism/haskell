Generate the lyrics of the song 'I Know an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly'.

While you could copy/paste the lyrics,
or read them from a file, this problem is much more
interesting if you approach it algorithmically.

This is a [cumulative song](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulative_song) of unknown origin.

This is one of many common variants.

## Hints

This exercise is about [code refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refactoring),
so we are providing you with a solution that already passes the tests.

The challenge is to rewrite it until you are proud of it, and learn
something in the process.

If you don't know where to start, here are some ideas:

- Try to reduce repetition to a minimum.
- Try to make the code readable.
- Generalize your solution, allowing the lady to swallow other things.

Take your time.

Change one thing at a time and check if your solution still passes the tests.

Have fun!



## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
