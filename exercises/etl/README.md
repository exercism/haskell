# ETL

We are going to do the `Transform` step of an Extract-Transform-Load.

### ETL

Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) is a fancy way of saying, "We have some crufty, legacy data over in this system, and now we need it in this shiny new system over here, so
we're going to migrate this."

(Typically, this is followed by, "We're only going to need to run this
once." That's then typically followed by much forehead slapping and
moaning about how stupid we could possibly be.)

### The goal

We're going to extract some scrabble scores from a legacy system.

The old system stored a list of letters per score:

- 1 point: "A", "E", "I", "O", "U", "L", "N", "R", "S", "T",
- 2 points: "D", "G",
- 3 points: "B", "C", "M", "P",
- 4 points: "F", "H", "V", "W", "Y",
- 5 points: "K",
- 8 points: "J", "X",
- 10 points: "Q", "Z",

The shiny new scrabble system instead stores the score per letter, which
makes it much faster and easier to calculate the score for a word. It
also stores the letters in lower-case regardless of the case of the
input letters:

- "a" is worth 1 point.
- "b" is worth 3 points.
- "c" is worth 3 points.
- "d" is worth 2 points.
- Etc.

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to transform the legacy data
format to the shiny new format.

### Notes

A final note about scoring, Scrabble is played around the world in a
variety of languages, each with its own unique scoring table. For
example, an "E" is scored at 2 in the MƒÅori-language version of the
game while being scored at 4 in the Hawaiian-language version.


## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/haskell).

## Running the tests

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
stack test
```

#### If you get an error message like this...

```
No .cabal file found in directory
```

You are probably running an old stack version and need
to upgrade it.

#### Otherwise, if you get an error message like this...

```
No compiler found, expected minor version match with...
Try running "stack setup" to install the correct GHC...
```

Just do as it says and it will download and install
the correct compiler version:

```bash
stack setup
```

## Running *GHCi*

If you want to play with your solution in GHCi, just run the command:

```bash
stack ghci
```
