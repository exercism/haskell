## Concepts

The F# concept exercises are based on concepts. The list below contains the concepts that have been identified for the F# language.

### Language-unique

- Active patterns
- Computation expressions
- Dependency order
- Type providers
- Units of measure

### Functional

- Expression-oriented (not statement oriented)
- Functions
  - Anonymous functions
  - Currying
  - Function composition
  - Higher-order functions
  - Implicit returns
  - Nested functions
  - Partial application
  - Pure functions
  - Recursion
    - Tail recursion
  - Type annotations
- Immutability
- Pattern matching
  - Discards
  - Guard clauses
- Pipelines
- Type inference
  - Automatic generalisation

### Object-oriented

The core OO features an F# developer should know about are:

- Classes
- Composition
- Encapsulation
- Fields
- Indexers
- Interfaces
  - Object expressions
- Methods
  - Constructors
  - Method arguments
    - Named arguments
    - Optional arguments
    - Out parameters
- Mutation
  - Reference cells
- Objects
- Properties
- State
- Structs
- Type extensions

While F# has OO features, it is a "functional first" language. It is important to know how and when to apply the OO features, and which OO features (see https://youtu.be/yL7xBhWrdKw?t=2248) to use.
