## Installing Stack

If you don't have a recent Stack version installed in your system, follow the
[installation instructions](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/)
for your operating system. After completing the installation, test that you
have installed it correctly by running this command in a terminal:

```bash
stack --version
```

If it outputs a Stack version equal to or greater than 1.1.2, then you have it
installed correctly.

## Installing GHC

Stack will automatically download and install GHC (the Glasgow Haskell
compiler) when it is required. You can start the installation and test
by running the following command in a terminal:

```bash
stack ghc
```

If this outputs something like `ghc: no input files`, GHC is installed
correctly.

Note that there are other ways to install GHC on a system (like the
[Haskell platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)), but for
running the Exercism tests, a regular stack installation is most
likely to work correctly.

## Installing HLint (optional)

HLint is a tool for suggesting possible improvements to Haskell code. These
suggestions include ideas such as using alternative functions, simplifying
code and spotting redundancies.

You can use Stack to install HLint:

```bash
stack install hlint
```

Check that it was installed correctly with:

```bash
hlint --version
```

If you get the version in your terminal, you're done, otherwise, you
probably need to add a missing directory to your path:

- `%APPDATA%\local\bin`, if you are running *Windows*
- `$HOME/.local/bin`, for other operating systems.

## Haskell IDEs and Plugins

Using an <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr> can make it easier to factor your Haskell programs. There are several free and commercial IDEs available
- [`atom-ide-haskell`](https://atom-haskell.github.io/) for Github's Atom editor
- There are [a number of Haskell packages](https://medium.com/@dogwith1eye/setting-up-haskell-in-vs-code-on-macos-d2cc1ce9f60a) for Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor.
- [IntelliJ Haskell Plugin](https://github.com/rikvdkleij/intellij-haskell)
- [Other Plugins](https://wiki.haskell.org/IDEs) referenced on the Haskell Wiki.
