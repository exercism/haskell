# Resources

* The [#haskell](https://web.libera.chat/?channel=#haskell) IRC channel on Libera Chat whose goal is to "encourage learning and discussion of Haskell, functional programming, and programming in general". More information about the IRC channel can be found on [the Haskell Wiki page for the channel](https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel).
* [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) is a Haskell API search engine. This allows you to look up what a function does if all you know is its name. Perhaps more interestingly, it also supports searching by type signature: If you want to know what functions have the type signature [(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=%28a+-%3E+b%29+-%3E+[a]+-%3E+[b]), Hoogle helps you find out!
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.
* [/r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell) is the Haskell subreddit.
* The [Haskell community page](https://www.haskell.org/community/) links to a number of communities where Haskellers gather and interact; from here you can choose your own preferred medium of communication.
