## Recommended Learning Resources

* The [#haskell](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=haskell) IRC channel on irc.freenode.net whose goal is to "encourage learning and discussion of Haskell, functional programming, and programming in general". More information about the IRC channel can be found on [the Haskell Wiki page for the channel](https://wiki.haskell.org/IRC_channel).
* [Hoogle](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/) is a Haskell API search engine. This allows you to look up what a function does if all you know is its name. Perhaps more interestingly, it also supports searching by type signature: If you want to know what functions have the type signature [(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]](https://www.haskell.org/hoogle/?hoogle=%28a+-%3E+b%29+-%3E+[a]+-%3E+[b]), Hoogle helps you find out!
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell) can be used to search for your problem and see if it has been answered already. You can also ask and answer questions.
* [/r/haskell](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell) is the Haskell subreddit.
