Haskell is a general-purpose programming language known for being purely functional, non-strict with strong static typing and for having type inference.

**Purely functional** means that you don't update variables or modify state.
Pure functions will always return the same value given the same input and will do nothing else.
Functions that are [referentially transparent](https://medium.com/@olxc/referential-transparency-93352c2dd713) are more predictable and more composable.
**Non-strict** (somewhat like [lazy](https://wiki.haskell.org/Lazy_vs._non-strict)) means that you can express infinite data structures.
**Strong static typing** means that a lot of program errors are caught during compilation.
**Type inference** means that the compiler can often figure out the type of a value by itself.
The compiler can also tell you if a value has conflicting types in different parts of the code.

There are more than 10,000 free third-party packages available at [Hackage](https://hackage.haskell.org/), the Haskell community's central package archive,
and you can download them using the [Stack](https://haskellstack.org/) tool that Exercism also uses.

You can also read the free book [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
or follow the interactive tutorial at [tryhaskell.org](https://www.tryhaskell.org/).
