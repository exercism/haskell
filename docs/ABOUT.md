Haskell is a lazy, purely functional programming language with strong support for 
concurrency. Though statically typed, Haskell has strong type inference so it is not 
necessary to write out every type when programming. 
Haskell has a reputation as a difficult language for beginners, but this is unwarranted.
In fact, functional languages similar to Haskell (such as Scheme and Racket) are taught in
beginning programming courses in many universities. These types of languages give both novice and advanced programmers a better understanding of the mathematical concepts
behind programming.
