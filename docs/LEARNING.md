# Learning

Haskell is a purely functional language, which is a paradigm fundamentally different than the more
commonly taught [object oriented approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming). Because of this,
learning Haskell can feel different than simply picking up another language.

Fortunately there are numerous resources which presume some programming knowledge to begin with, such
as

  - An opinionated beginner's guide to Haskell ([2019](https://github.com/theindigamer/not-a-blog/blob/master/opinionated-haskell-guide-2019.md), [2018](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2018/02/10/an-opinionated-guide-to-haskell-in-2018/))
  - the popular and free online book [Learn You a Haskell For Great Good!](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/)
  - University of Glasgow's [Functional Programming in Haskell](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/functional-programming-haskell) course
  - FP Complete's [School of Haskell](https://www.schoolofhaskell.com/)
  - the [Happy Learn Haskell Tutorial](http://www.happylearnhaskelltutorial.com/)
  - [Haskell for Mac](http://learn.hfm.io/)'s tutorials

Some recent Haskell books include
  - [Haskell Programming From First Principles](https://haskellbook.com) by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki (this book does not presume prior programming knowledge)
  - [Programming in Haskell](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/programming-haskell-2nd-edition?format=PB&isbn=9781316626221) by Graham Hutton

You may also refer to the [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Learning_Haskell#Online_tutorials) for an abundance of other resources on beginning.
